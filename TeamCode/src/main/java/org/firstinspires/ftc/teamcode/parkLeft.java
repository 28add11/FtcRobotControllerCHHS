/*
 *
 * The code assumes that you do NOT have encoders on the wheels,
 *   otherwise you would use: RobotAutoDriveByEncoder;
 *
 * The code also assumes an omni-wheel drivetrain
 *
 *   The desired path in this example is:
 *   - Strafe left for 1.4 seconds
 *   - Move forwards for 2.0 seconds
 *   - Spin around 360 degrees
 *   - Reverse for 2.0 seconds
 *
 *
 *  The code is written in a simple form with no optimizations.
 *  However, there are several ways that this type of sequence could be streamlined,
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
